                   The Difference between document and window object

Document Object:

      * The document object is a core part of the Document Object Model (DOM), 
      representing the web page's structure and content. 
      
      * It provides a structured representation of the HTML content and allows JavaScript to access and manipulate 
      elements within the document.

      * The document object is primarily used to access and manipulate the elements of a 
      web page. 

      * JavaScript can interact with the content within the document object, allowing developers 
      to dynamically update text, images, styles, and other visual elements on the page without 
      requiring a full page reload.

      * The document object is used to attach event listeners to various elements on the page. 
      This enables developers to respond to user interactions such as clicks, keyboard input,
      and form submissions.

window Object:

      * The window object allows developers to interact with the browser itself. 
      It provides methods for opening and closing browser windows, as well as for 
      navigating to different URLs.

      * JavaScript can utilize the window object to set timeouts and intervals using 
      setTimeout and setInterval functions, respectively.

      * The window object offers information about the browser, such as screen dimensions, 
      history, location, and more.

      * Variables and functions declared without the var, let, or const keywords become 
      properties of the window object and can be accessed globally. This is sometimes 
      referred to as the "global scope
